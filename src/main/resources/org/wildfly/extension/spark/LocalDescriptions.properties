cassandra=My subsystem
cassandra.add=Adds the cassandra subsystem
cassandra.remove=Removes the cassandra subsystem
cassandra.cluster=A named cassandra cluster configuration
cassandra.cluster.add=Add a cassandra cluster configuration
cassandra.cluster.remove=Remove a cluster configuration
cassandra.cluster.debug=Enable cassandra diagnostics (TODO).

cassandra.cluster.num-tokens=This defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to this node on the ring. The more tokens, relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data that this node will store. You probably want all nodes to have the same numbe of tokens assuming they have equal hardware capability.
cassandra.cluster.hinted-handoff-enabled=http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/HintedHandoff
cassandra.cluster.authenticator=Authentication backend, implementing IAuthenticator
cassandra.cluster.authorizer=Authorization backend, implementing IAuthorizer
cassandra.cluster.partitioner=The partitioner is responsible for distributing rows (by key) across nodes in the cluster


cassandra.cluster.seed-provider-class-name=any class that implements the SeedProvider interface
cassandra.cluster.seed-provider-seeds=Addresses of hosts that are deemed contact points


cassandra.cluster.listen-address=Address to bind to and tell other Cassandra nodes to connect to. You must change this if you want multiple nodes to be able to communicate!
cassandra.cluster.broadcast-address=Address to broadcast to other Cassandra nodes.
cassandra.cluster.start-native-transport=Whether to start the native transport server.
cassandra.cluster.native-transport-port=port for the CQL native transport to listen for clients on
cassandra.cluster.start-rpc=Whether to start the thrift rpc server.
cassandra.cluster.rpc-address=The address to bind the Thrift RPC service and native transport server -- clients connect here
cassandra.cluster.rpc-port=port for Thrift to listen for clients on
cassandra.cluster.internode-authenticator=Internode authentication backend, implementing IInternodeAuthenticator
cassandra.cluster.data-file-directories=Directories where Cassandra should store data on disk
cassandra.cluster.saved-caches-directory=saved caches directory
cassandra.cluster.commitlog-directory=Commit log directory
cassandra.cluster.commitlog-sync=commitlog-sync may be either "periodic" or "batch."
cassandra.cluster.commitlog-sync-period-in-ms=TODO
cassandra.cluster.endpoint-snitch=Set this to a class that implements IEndpointSnitch
cassandra.cluster.request-scheduler=Set this to a class that implements RequestScheduler
cassandra.cluster.server-encryption-enabled=Enable or disable inter-node encryption
cassandra.cluster.client-encryption-enabled=enable or disable client/server encryption.
